    <h1>tetrachord</h1>
</div>

The tetrachord is a fundamental building block of the Ancient Greek tuning system. According to Boethius, a full scale consists of the lowest tone (the proslambanomenos), the hypaton tetrachord which begins a whole tone up from the proslambanomenos, a conjunct (i.e., sharing a note) tetrachord called the meson, *either* a conjunct tetrachord called the synemmenon or a disjunct one called the diezeugmenon, which begins a whole tone up from the mese on a note called the paramese, and finally the hyperboleon tetrachord, which is either a wholetone up from the synemmenon tetrachord or conjunct with the diezeugmenon tetrachord.

Every tetrachord in the scale will be tuned such that the intervals are proportionate to each other. The intervals in one tetrachord will sound identical to the intervals within another.
