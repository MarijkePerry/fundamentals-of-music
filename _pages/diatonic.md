<h1>diatonic</h1>

The diatonic genus is one of three genera typically used in Ancient Greek music. The diatonic is characterized by having a relatively small interval between the 3rd to 4th note in the tetrachord, especially when compared to chromatic or enharmonic tuning. In modern musical terms, a diatonic tetrachord might sound approximate to a half step followed by two whole steps. A full diatonic scale, using the diezeugmenon, sounds similar to a modern minor scale. 

Aristoxenus further divides the diatonic into two sub-genera, the sharp diatonic and the soft diatonic. The sharp diatonic sounds most similar to the diatonic put forth by Archytas and Boethius, while the soft diatonic flattens the 3rd note.
