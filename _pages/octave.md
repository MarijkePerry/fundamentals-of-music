The octave is one of the fundamental intervals of the Ancient Greek musical tuning system. It is a consonance and can be heard by plucking two strings, one of which is double the length of the other. The octave is so related to the ratio of 1:2. Accordingly, a note that is one octave up from a previous one will be twice the frequency, and a note that is an octave down from the previous one will be half the frequency (i.e., an A one octave up from an one tuned to 432 Hz would have a frequency of 864 Hz, or an A one octave down from 432 would have a frequency of 216 Hz).
