<h1>fifth</h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3>the diapente</h3>

The fifth is another consonance in Ancient Greek music. It can be heard to plucking two strings with lengths in a ratio of 2:3 (i.e., one is 50% longer than the other). The frequencies of two notes heard as a fifth apart will likewise adhere to this ratio: a fifth up from an A at 432 Hz would be a note at 648 Hz, approximately an E in modern tuning.
