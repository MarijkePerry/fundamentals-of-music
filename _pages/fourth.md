The fourth is also a consonance in Ancient Greek music. A harmonic fourth can be created by plucking two strings, one of which is longer than the other by a ratio of 3:4. Ergo, if the first string is 9 centimeters long, the second would be 12 centimeters long. The frequencies of two notes heard as a fourth apart will likewise adhere to this ratio: a fourth up from an A at 432 Hz would be a note at 576 Hz, approximately a D in modern tuning.
