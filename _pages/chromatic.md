The chromatic genus is one of three genera typically used in Ancient Greek music. The chromatic is characterized by having a moderately sized interval between the 3rd to 4th note in the tetrachord, with the interval being larger than the one found in the diatonic and smaller than the one found in the enharmonic. In modern musical terms, a chromatic tetrachord might sound approximate to two half steps followed by a minor third.

Aristoxenus further divides the chromatic into two sub-genera, the tonic chromatic, the hemiolic chromatic, and the soft chromatic. The hemiolic chromatic has a flatter 2nd and 3rd note than the tonic chromatic, and the soft chromatic has a flatter 2nd and 3rd note than the hemiolic.
